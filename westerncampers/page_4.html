            A landscape created by molten lava, Lava Beds National Monument located in California “contains volcanic tablelands punctuated by cinder cones, pit craters, and spatter cones, plus more than 700 caves.”(Visit California) The caves and other features were formed  "10,500–65,000 years ago, when the outer edges of flowing lava began to cool, forming tubes. When molten lava stopped flowing, hardened tubes were left behind.” (Visit California)  The great thing about the caves is that you can explore the tubes on your own (no need for a guide, and kids love to explore the amazing caves that were formed). Inside the caves, it is pitch black. A dark so surreal that you could almost seem to be asleep. Make sure you bring flashlights and all the equipment you think you might need. I would say bring a helmet, for in the caves there are low ceilings and if you stand up to fast you could hit your head. Also, be on the lookout for bats as they can sometimes be seen hanging in the caves. These caves were also "used as hideouts during the Modoc War in 1872–73, the only fight against Native Americans in California, in which Native Americans fought U.S. Army troops in defense of their homelands.”(Vist California) Theses caves are an amazing place to visit and camp out here in the west.
