        Welcome to WesternCampers where camping can be fun! WesternCampers is a site dedicated to helping you to know more about good places to camp in the western United States. Well, today is a great day to check out our site. Let’s take a look at the west, shall we? So, our first stop is in Nevada. Nevada is a fantastic place, over 80% of it being BLM land. There are 24 state parks. Nevada is my home state, so I am very fond of it! It is a beautifully sculpted area, with purple mountains, incredible sunsets, and lakes. In Nevada is the Lake Tahoe Campgrounds, and also the Great Basin National Park Campgrounds. We will also explore the Lava Beds National Monument in California so get ready to take a peek at some great places for a camping adventure!

      <h3>Lake Tahoe Campgrounds</h3>
      <p>
        One of my favorite lakes and camping spots in Nevada is Lake Tahoe. Lake Tahoe is a deep lake, and over two million years old. It attracts many people from California and is a great ski attraction. The lake lies at 6,225 feet, which is 1.15 a mile. Lake Tahoe is 1,645 feet deep. The Truckee river flows out of Lake Tahoe northeast to Pyramid Lake. The water of Lake Tahoe has been tested for purity and is 99.994% pure. Eight campgrounds around Lake Tahoe are  D.L Bliss State Park Campground,  Meeks Bay Resort and Marina,  Meeks Bay Campground,  Fallen Leaf Campground,  Eagle Point Campground, Bayview Campground, Campgrounds at Camp Richardson Historic Resort and Marina, and Campground by the Lake. Come on down to the lake and camp!

      <h3> Great Basin National Park Campgrounds</h3>
      <p>
        The Great Basin National Park is a high desert that has some of the state’s tallest peaks, which hold the state of Nevada’s glacier, cascading mountain streams, alpine lakes, the ancient bristlecone pine forest(which can live 4,000 years plus), and the state’s largest and cave system, Lehman Caves. Wheeler peak stands at 13,064 feet and is Nevada’s third-tallest mountain. The Great Basin National Park has a lot of diverse plant and animal life. It is also where many campers go to stargaze. The park is known as an International Dark Sky Park, a  great place for gazing at the stars. Watch out though there are mountain lions about the park. Make sure you bring your bear spray as protection in case one attacks. The closest town Baker doesn’t have very many resources so be sure to bring what you need! Camping here is amazing!

      <h3> Lava Beds National Monument</h3>
      <p>
        A landscape created by molten lava, Lava Beds National Monument located in California has lands filled with cinder cones, pit craters, spatter cones, and more than 700 caves. The caves and other features were formed 10,500–65,000 years ago, when flowing lava began to cool, forming tubes. When molten lava stopped flowing, hardened tubes were left behind. The great thing about the caves is that you can explore the tubes on your own (no need for a guide, and kids love to explore the amazing caves that were formed. Inside the caves, it is pitch black. A dark so surreal that you could almost seem to be asleep. Make sure you bring flashlights and all the equipment you think you might need. I would say bring a helmet, for in the caves there are low ceilings and if you stand up to fast you could hit your head. Also, be on the lookout for bats as they can sometimes be seen hanging out in the caves. These caves were once used as hideouts during the Modoc War in 1872–1873, in a fight against Native Americans in California, in which Native Americans fought U.S. Army troops in defense of the land. The caves are an amazing place to visit and camp out here in the west.
